# Growth+

Millions of children across Africa struggle with basic math. Yet they have increasing access to smartphones at home. Our vision is to tackle this need through a mobile application that empowers parents to provide their children with fundamental math skills. Our project, Growth+, is a mobile app designed to target numeracy, the ability to understand and use fundamental math skills, in Africa. While a couple educational apps have been developed in East Africa, our app will be the first to primarily target numeracy in Central and West Africa.

Designed specifically for areas with little to no internet, our application works fully offline and uses limited storage on smartphones. Additionally, our app functions in three main languages: French, English, and Chadian Arabic, with options to add more local languages. Our vision is a better future for African children through improved math skills, and this starts with parents and their children using Growth+.
