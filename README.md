# Growth+

## About Growth +
Growth+ is a mobile application designed to target numeracy, 
the ability to understand and work with numbers, in francophone Africa. 
This project has been developed as a response to the lack of educational resources related to basic math skills. 
Students in Africa have fewer opportunities to gain these skills and as a result, numeracy is low in many countries.
